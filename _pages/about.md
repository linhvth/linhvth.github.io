I am a second-year Master's student and Graduate Research Assistant in **Computational Operations Research** at William & Mary. In my role, I contribute to work sponsored by the Gates Foundation, where we solve problems related to the optimization of clinical trials.

Beyond my current research, I am particularly interested in **Statistical Machine Learning**, **Learning Theory**, and **Optimization**. I operate on the belief that breakthroughs in high-level challenges don't come from more complexity, but from a deeper, more critical understanding of fundamental knowledge and a willingness to question our most basic assumptions.

Outside of my study, I recharge by hiking, immersing myself in classic cinema, and following the social movements and global events that shape our contemporary landscape.
